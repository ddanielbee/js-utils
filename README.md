# Javascript Utils
Some (maybe) usefull Javascript utility functions that solve problems I've come across in the wild (when for some reason or another I'm not allowed to use lodash, of course). Each one of these functions has been written while trying to solve a problem at work or on my free time. Feel free to use, fork, add new ones, yell at me, whatever you want.  

### Testing
I'm using [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for the tests since it doesn't need much configuration and does it's job well for these small test suites.

After `npm install`, tests are run with `npm test`.
